# LeiosOS

Hello and welcome to my website, hosted by Github. I am James Schloss, a PhD student at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST). Feel free to ask me any question you like, and I will do my best to answer it -- preferrably with code! 

On this site, I will post all of my fantastic online adventures! By that I mean that I'll be posting science stuff. A lot of science stuff. In fact, any time I do something science-y that is not related to research, I will put it here. 

Most of these projects have been livecoded on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/simuleios). Feel free to join us at some point! I stream daily from 5-7 AM JST. I don't know what time that is in your timezone, but it works pretty well for Europeans and Americans. I will also make youtube videos on my [channel](http://youtube.com/c/leiosos) related to the content I am coding up every month, so feel free to check that out as well.

My theme is called [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Feel free to check it out!

Peace,
James
