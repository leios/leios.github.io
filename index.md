Hello and welcome to LeiosLabs, the hub for all projects lead by James Schloss (Leios)!
I primarily work on computational science research while also trying to engage the public through [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LeiosOS/), [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/leioslabs), [twitter](https://twitter.com/LeiosOS), or any other website I can find.

All ongoing and completed projects can be found on the sidebar.
If you are interested in hiring me, please contact me through my e-mail at [jrs.schloss@gmail.com](mailto:jrs.schloss@gmail.com).
