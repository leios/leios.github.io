Hello and welcome to LeiosOS, the hub for all online projects lead by James Schl
oss (Leios)! In this remote cave of the internet, we rediscover the laws of natu
re through blood, sweat, and code (in varying quantities). Feel free to check ou
t our work on the grey bar over there. If you like what you see, check out our c
ommunity on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/simuleios) (5-7 AM JST) or [Youtube](h
ttps://www.youtube.com/c/leiosos) (every other Sunday).

I have marked all of the projects we have worked on with a number ranging <span 
style="color:red">0</span> - <span style="color:green">100</span> depending on t
heir completeness. Projects that are fully complete have youtube videos accompan
ying them that describe what the project was and why it was / is cool.

A few quick notes:

* My actual research will not be hosted on this site (at least not until after i
t has been published).

* Feel free to comment on anything or drop me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Leio
sOS). If I am wrong about something, I am wrong about something. Be sure to let 
me know so I can fix it in the near future!

* All of these projects are licenced under the MIT license, which means it is op
en source, so feel free to use it; however, if any of this work is ever used in 
a research project, please let me know and I will do my best to help out in any 
way I can!

Toodles,

Leios
