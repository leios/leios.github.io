## An argument for livecoding

As some of you may know, I run a channel on twitch that is almost exclusively devoted to computational physics.
Almost every morning from 5-7AM JST, I am there learning some sort of physics algorithm, and I have to admit that it has had a dramatically positive impact on my programming technique.

In essence, this post boils down to the following:

*I want to see more people livecoding.*

I honestly believe it is a perfect way to hone your programming skills and to become better at the craft for a number of reasons:

## 1. It is the ultimate form of pair programming

As of late, I have been hearing many programmers talk about peer programming, where a company or group of individuals pair an advanced programmer with a novice in order to help the novice become better and begin developing his or her own code.
It is a great idea that helps the mentor better develop their own abilities while also helping the mentee learn the ropes. 

livecoding allows you to become part of a community of pair programmers. 
They watch and learn from you while also suggesting ways for you to improve or more efficient ways to write the code. 

## 2. It forces you to focus on your faults

There have been quite a few times that I have 

Now, you might be hesitant to start livecoding for the following reasons:

1. your code is crap
2. you don't know how to get started
3. you are a boring person
