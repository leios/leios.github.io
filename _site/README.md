# LeiosLabs

Hello and welcome to my website, hosted by Github.
I am Dr. James Schloss.
I focus on the overlap between GPGPU computing and science communication.
Feel free to ask me any question you like, and I will do my best to answer it -- preferrably with code! 

My theme is called [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Feel free to check it out!

Peace,
James
