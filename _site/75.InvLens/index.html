<h2>Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)</h2>

<p>The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is one of the most useful computational methods in the field of electricity and magnetism (which is a pretty active field, if you know the right people). What is it? It&#39;s basically a simulation of the Electric and Magnetic fields in a typical electromagnetic wave. How does it work? Well, that might be a little complicated to explain, so let&#39;s start with soemthing simple-ish: Maxwell&#39;s Equations.</p>

<p>Maxwell&#39;s Equations are incredibly useful. They tell us how electric and magnetic fields are related to each other in time and space, in particular, they look like this:</p>

<p>$$\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$$</p>

<p>$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon _0}$$ </p>

<p>$$\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu _0 \vec{J} + \mu _0 \epsilon _0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$$</p>

<p>$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$</p>

<p>What do these mean? Well,  that depends on who you ask and what we are talking about, but for the most part, the mean the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are no Magnetic monopoles</li>
<li>[Gauss&#39;s Law] Charge is conserved unless something else acts on the system</li>
<li>[Amphere&#39;s Law] The magnetic field is related to the change in electric field over time</li>
<li>[Faraday&#39;s Law] The electric field is related to the change in magnetic field over time</li>
</ol>

<p>For FDTD simulations, we only care about the last two because we are trying to find a way to relate the electric and magnetic field in a wave. I mean, for this purpose, who cares if charge is conserved or if there are no such things as magnetic monopoles? </p>

<p>From this information, it would look like we have equations and we know what electromagnetic waves should look like, so that should mean that we are set to start our simulation, right?</p>

<p>Well... Not exactly. Computers do not think like we do, so we need to discretize Maxwell&#39;s Equations. What does that mean? Well, it means that we need to take a continuous system (nature) and split it into a bunch of little blocks that a computer can understand.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s take a minute to think about what we know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The electric field is dependent on the variance of the magnetic field with time</li>
<li>the magnetic field is dependent on the variance of the electric field with time</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s constrain ourselves to 1 dimension for now and a row of points. Each point will correspond to the electric field at some point in space. With only this one line, we could enforce an electric field distribution by setting all the points to appropriate values and waving our hands in the air like we just don&#39;t care; however, this distribution would be stuck, unmoving for all eternity. How do we get it to move?</p>

<p>Well, we introduce a string of magnetic field points exactly halfway between each electric field point. In this case, though, we do not assign the magnetic field values. Instead, we allow the magnetic field to be calculated from the electric field -- where each individual magnetic field point is related to the average of the two nearest electric field points. </p>

<p>So now we have a bit of a situation. The magnetic field is going to change in the very next time step! This is super exciting because it means that the magnetic field is changing with time. What else happens when the magnetic field changes with time? </p>

<p>Right! The electric field also changes! Of course, this is an endless cycle, because the moment the electric field changes, the magnetic field will also change. And then the electric field will change again!
In this way, we have simulated Maxwell&#39;s equations in distritized time and space with an incredibly intuitive method. </p>

<p>Now, I know what you are thinking, &quot;Let&#39;s just plug in this newfangled FDTD nonsense to our index of refraction profile and move on with our lives!&quot; The truth is that life is not that simple. </p>

<p>Just because we can simulate a 1 dimensional wave does not mean we can simulate a lens in 2 dimensions. We need to make a few modifications, some of which are easier than others:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extend the code to 2 dimensions</li>
<li>Force the wave to move in 1 direction only</li>
<li>Stop the wave from moving at some point.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all of these seem like they should be simple, right? In fact, the first one is. It&#39;s just a matter of keepign track of your new 2-dimensional array. The latter two, though... they can be a little tricky. They require the introduction of two new devices: the <a href="#TFSF">total-field scattered-field boundary</a> and <a href="#ABC">absorbing boundary conditions</a>.</p>

<p><a href name="TFSF"></a></p>

<h3>Total-Field Scattered-Field (TFSF) boundaries</h3>

<p>What is a Total-Field Scattered-Field (TFSF) boundary? Well, I am glad you asked! It is a boundary that splits your electromagnetic wave into two parts: </p>

<ul>
<li>Total field</li>
<li>Scattered Field</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s literally in the name. But what does this mean? It means that when we create a wave at some point, we can split the wave into two sections --  one that goes right and one that goes left. If we keep one of the sides from propagating, we have a TFSF bounday! This means that the wave is only moving in 1 direction!</p>

<p>Why is that cool? Well, think about what we are doing right now. We are trying to simulate an invisible lens. How can we do that without having a wave that moves in a single direction: towards the lens.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s talk about our ABC&#39;s!</p>

<p><a href name="ABC"></a></p>

<h3>Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABC)</h3>

<p>So, we have a problem. When the wave hits the edge of a box, it bounces back. Why? Well, it&#39;s still trying to solve Maxwell&#39;s equations, right? This means that the magnetic field changes based on the electric field and the electric field changes based on the magnetic field. In this case, if the electric field gets stuck on a wall, our algorithm will just resolve Maxwell&#39;s equations and send the wave back where it came from. This can lead to some interesting physics, but it might not be what you want all the time. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say we want to pretend our wave is ongoing for all eternity. In this case, we need to do something to our very last elements in our row (or grid in 2 dimensions). What do we need to do? Well, we need to set up a little trap. Sure, we&#39;ll allow the electric and magnetic field to move to the very last grid poing, but when they do, we do something nasty:</p>

<p>We set the very last element to be the value of the second-to-last element (or the very first element to be the second).</p>

<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that there is no longer a difference between the two electric field points, which means there is no magnetic field... and without a magnetic field, the electric field can no longer exist!</p>

<p>This is, in essence, an ABC. Sure. It might not sound too menacing, but it can be depending on the rules you have layed out for yourself. For example, in 2 dimensions, this simple case of setting the two final elements equal to each other will not longer work because you could have the wave moving in a way that is not directly perpendicular to the edge. What a shame that would be. What do you do in that case? Well, that is exactly what we are trying to figure out right now!</p>
