# About the Author

I am Dr. James Schloss.
I received my PhD in 2019 from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST).
While there, I studied quantum systems by simulating them with my Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
After that, I have been working off and on in the Julia Lab at MIT (a very prominent research arm of the Julia programming language), where I have worked on various scientific computing projects such as climate and molecular simulations.
All of these projects have been done on the GPU.
Though I would not consider myself to be a core developer of the JuliaGPU ecosystem, I have contributed to several packages, including KernelAbstractions(.jl), the GPU interface we are using for this work.

I also run the (relatively) popular youtube channel and twitch stream Leios Labs, where we have been developing a book for uncommon algorithms known as the *Arcane Algorithm Archive*.
Some of the chapters in this book were inspired by that work.
I have also worked with Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) on several projects, including the Summer of Math Exposition, where we encouraged thousands of online content creators to make more math content online.

I have always said, "Your research is only as good as your ability to communicate it."
The way I see it, there are very few people who have a deep understanding of GPU technology who are also good at communicating that understanding to others.

This book is my attempt to do both.
I might not be the best programmer.
I might not be the best communicator.
But I am going to try my best to make this work as understandable and enjoyable as possible.

# Prominent Reviewers

Any academic work is only as good as the peers who read and critique it.
For that reason, I intend to keep a list of "Prominent Reviewers" who don't mind putting their name in this section.
This should be a list of academics or core community members who have either been asked to review the work due to their expertise or have contributed significantly in the beta reading phase.
