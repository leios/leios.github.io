# What's Going On?

When I started my PhD in 2014, it was fairly uncommon for programmers to use their Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for any computation beyond what was necessary for gaming or some graphical applications.
The world has changed since then.
Nowadays, it feels like the GPU is the most important piece of hardware on any computational device (supercomputers, desktops, phones, etc).
Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) for movies and games have become almost photorealistic, and all of the necessary computation happens on the GPU.
The fastest supercomputers in the world run GPUs.
Machine learning models are trained using GPUs.
Everyone needs the GPU for *something*.

At the same time, there are very few good learning resources available to teach beginner programmers how to properly use their hardware.
So that's what this book is.
It is a gentle introduction to most of the programming concepts necessary to understand GPU computing through meaningful, real-world applications.
