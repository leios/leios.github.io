# Welcome

Hello and welcome to LeiosLabs, the home of all projects lead by Dr. James Schloss (me).

On the sidebar, you will find a scattered selection of my writings.
I also have worked on several other projects that might be interesting such as:

* [The Algorithm Archive](https://www.algorithm-archive.org): An online repository of algorithms
* [JuliaGPU](https://juliagpu.org/): A cross-platform GPU computational framework
* [Fable.jl](https://www.leioslabs.com/Fable.jl/dev/): A fractal-based, general-purpose animation engine
* [The Summer of Math Exposition](https://some.3b1b.co/): A kickstart into math content creation
