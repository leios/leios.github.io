The goal of Leios Labs is to do high-quality, computational research and communicate this research as effectively as possible.

## About Me (Leios)

I finished my PhD at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://admissions.oist.jp/) in December of 2019 before working at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) for a year on the [Climate Machine](https://clima.caltech.edu/) project.
I worked with [Grant Sanderson on 3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) before returning to MIT to work on the [CESMIX](https://cesmix.mit.edu/) project.
I'm in charge of an online repository of Algorithms known as the [Arcane Algorithm Archive](https://www.algorithm-archive.org/) and run the youtube channel [LeiosLabs](https://www.youtube.com/c/LeiosOS/) with close to 100,000 subscribers along with it's corresponding [twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/leioslabs).

For my PhD, I focused primarily on GPGPU computing by solving the NonLinear Schrodinger Equation (also called the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, GPE) on the GPU by building the package [GPUE](https://gpue-group.github.io/).

For MIT, I focused on heterogeneous computing with the [KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl) package and implementing it into large computational simulations.

At 3Blue1Brown, I focused on many things, including the launch of the [Summer of Math Exposition](https://some.3b1b.co/), a competition that has encouraged thousands of new math content creators online.

The Algorithm Archive has the impossible goal of creating an online textbook that rivals Numerical Recipes in every programming language.
This is done with the help of a community of individuals that help curate all the languages.
At the current time, the Algorithm Archive is on a brief hiatus while I focus other research.
