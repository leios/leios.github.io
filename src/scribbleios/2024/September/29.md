There are times to fight. There are times to flee.\
Now I am curious. Which could this be?\
Before me stood a hero glowing bright,\ 
Her skin now glistening after a fight.\
She was self-righteous. One who villains fear.\
Yet I sensed something off when she drew near.\

I am an empath. I sense emotion.\
I give my craft undying devotion.\
When people appear as they ought to be,\
I see them just as they present to me.\
