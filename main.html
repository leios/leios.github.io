<h1>Are you ready to code?</h1>
Hey guys, this is where I will start posting some of my new videos and things related to youtube, github, or coding in general. I realize it's not very fancy right now. I'm working on that!

Here's the goal: to provide interesting stuff for you guys to read in a somewhat streamline fashion. I need to figure out how to make a box around this text so it wraps differently and I need to figure out how to imbed youtube videos. I also need to create a good organizational scheme for navigation and such. I think that is all for now. Toodles!
