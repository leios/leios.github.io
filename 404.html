  <p class="lead">Sometimes you're lucky. Sometimes your not. In this case, you are incredibly unlucky that the person who was working on this site was an incompetent fool who didn't even know how to direct you to the appropriate links! No, no. Don't try to stick up for him, he really should have known better! He was just another arrogant physicist, thinking he could just waltz on in and fully understand how web development worked, well he couldn't! He doesn't know everything, no matter how much he might think he does.

Anyway, you should probably <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">head back home</a>. </p>
